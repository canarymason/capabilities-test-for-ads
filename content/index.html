          <p>Content Strategy is a process by which, through a content audit and examination of business needs, a holistic understanding of a business's content is achieved in order to best serve said business and its users. It is one of the most essential parts to design as it lays the groundwork for each feature that gets developed, be it for a web property, a native app property, a content feed, or any other mode of consumption.</p>

<p>The content strategy process should start with a goal for the design and development process. Each project needs a purpose and by defining a goal at the beginning of the process it becomes easier to identify what will provide the most value and ultimately produce a better end result.</p>

<p>At it most essential, a content audit is an overview of the different types of content available on your site and what individual chunks make up those chunks of content. This can include different types of media, taxonomy terms, published content types, and content grouping mechanisms. Each item should have a descriptive list of fields and meta information to round out the information that make up that chunk of content, including what chunks are required and what chunks are optional. When developing this list, it is important to keep in mind that content no longer exclusively lives on websites and that blobs of content (blocks of HTML formatted text) are not ideal for cross-platform content reusability.</p>

<p>Doing a full content audit will also provide important insights into what content is most valuable to one's users, and therefore most valuable to the site owner. This should be done with the aid of analysis of site analytics and business needs.</p>

<p>Each chunk of content in a content audit should include a benefit statement and a value proposition. These are both driven by business needs. A benefit statement is a goal whose progress can be measured towards, such as increasing number of page views or reducing operating costs. A value proposition is a measurement of worth and can be as simple as gross revenue generated, as complex as a comparison of revenue and page views to total development and editorial hours and cost required to produce, or anything in between.</p>
